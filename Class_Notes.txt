Saturday, 21st Jan - Authentication and Authorisation


Authentication: Verify
Authorisation: permissions to use some data etc.

First step we do is registration for the site to remember the user.
MIddleware: Is where we place the code.



Authorization can be done in many ways.
	0.	Token based: JasonWebToken
	0.	Server side sessions.

jwt.io - tokens
Red colour text : is the header using all: HS256
Pink colour data: is the payload data (user)
Blue colour text : verification signature. The server will check this key, validate and decrypt the data (imp)



NPM library: JWT
https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken

jwt.sign method is used for token.
jwt.verfiy: validates the token and the secret key.
